This IP is built and available for NI VeriStand 2010 thru 2014 [here](http://www.ni.com/example/31246/en/) but will be taken down soon.

### Quality, Limitations ###

This IP should be considered mature, but of low quality. The code is kind of crazy and was the work of three different people. However, it works, and has worked in deployed systems since 2010.
